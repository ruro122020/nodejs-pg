Simple example to connect to a postgres database from a nodejs server. I used the following technologies:

- pg is to assign it to the client, among other things
- bcrypt is to hash the password before storing it to database
- dotenv is to store sensative information required to connect to database
- express is a nodejs framework, makes it easy to start up a server, among other things
- knex is a framework to query data to a sql database
