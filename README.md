Simple example to connect to a postgres database from a nodejs server. I used the following technologies:

.._ pg - this is to assign it to the client
.._ bcrypt - to hash the password before storing it to database
.._ dotenv - to store sensative information required to connect to database
.._ express - nodejs framework, makes it easy to start up a server, among other things
..\* knex - sql framework to query data to the database
