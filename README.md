Simple example to connect to a postgres database from a nodejs server. I used the following technologies:

- pg this is to assign it to the client
- bcrypt to hash the password before storing it to database
- dotenv to store sensative information required to connect to database
- express nodejs framework, makes it easy to start up a server, among other things
- knex sql framework to query data to the database
